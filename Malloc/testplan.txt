Motivation for Workload E:

This workload allows us to see if the free blocks are merging correctly
      If they do, then the 80 bytes would take the place of the blocks that were just freed
      Including the allocation for 120 bytes allows us to determine if more than two free blocks are merging correctly

Workload E:
  Allocate 40-byte blocks 95 times
      Store pointers in an array
  For the first 32 40-byte blocks
      Free two blocks and then allocate 80 bytes
  For the next 63 40-byte blocks
      Free three blocks and then allocate 120 bytes
  Free all 80-byte and 120-byte blocks

Motivation for Workload F:
     By allocating a random number between 4 and 6, we can determine if malloc handles the situation correctly when it doesn't have enough space to create a second set of metadata

Workload F:
    Allocate 7 bytes 101 times
    Free first block, then increment pointer by 20 and free that
      Do this 46 times
    Allocate memory for a random number between 4 and 6 bytes 46 times
    Free the first block, and then increment the pointer by 10 and free that
      Do this 101 times. This will free all pointers.
