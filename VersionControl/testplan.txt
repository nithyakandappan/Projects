Consider doing these steps one by one, in order
1. Test launching the server
2. Test the configure method in the client - if it does not exist, the client cannot execute any command
3. Test create
	** check if the project already exists on either the server or client
	** check the server side folder structure after the create
4. Test add, into the project created in step 3
	** check if the project exists
	** check if the file physically exists on the client side
	** check if the file is already in .Manifest
	** check client .Manifest after the add
5. Test commit
	** check if the project exists
	** create a fake .Update file to see if the commit could go through --the commit is not supposed to be successful in this case
	** check the .Commit file after commit
6. Test push
	** check if the project and .Commit exists 
	** check .Manifest after push
	** check the server side archive of the older version
	** check version number and history (combined with the next two tests)
7. Test currentversion
	** compare the output with the server .Manifest
8. Test history
	** compare the output with the server .History
9. Prepare update, upgrade & rollback tests and Test remove - creating a situation where you need to get an update from the server - SEE testcases.txt which is more clear
	** save a copy of the current project folder, so subsequent changes to the server can be updated into the saved copy
	** execute an "add" followed by commit and push
	** test remove
		** check if the file exists in client .Manifest
		** check .Manifest after remove
		** execute commit and push after remove
	** manually modify a client side file to create a "modify" scenario, followed by commit and push
	** rename saved earlier version client project folder to the project name
10. Test update
	** check .Update after update command
11. Test upgrade
	** manually rename .Update to see if upgrade could go through
	** record client .Manifest before update
	** compare client .Manifest before and after update
12. Test checkout
	** rename a client project
	** checkout the project that has been renamed 
	** check the folder and files in the checked out project directory
13. Test destroy
	** create two projects
	** delete the two projects
	** check the folder names on the client and server side
	** delete client side folders after server project is destroyed
14. Test rollback
	** check currentversion, check server side folder structure
	** rollback to one version earlier
	** check currentversion
	** check server side folder structure
	** check history
